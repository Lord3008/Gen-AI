Democracy is a system of government where power is vested in the hands of the people, either directly or through elected representatives. It is based on the principles of equality, freedom, and fairness, ensuring that every citizen has a voice in the decision-making process, typically through voting. In a democracy, fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press are protected, allowing open dialogue and the exchange of ideas. The rule of law prevails, ensuring accountability and preventing the concentration of power in any one branch of government. This system fosters transparency, civic participation, and the protection of minority rights, making it a vital mechanism for promoting justice and social harmony in diverse societies.
